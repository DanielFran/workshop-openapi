# Generate our first JHipster application
First, we need to choose a root folder where we will create all our projects.
To simplify I will use `/tmp` as the root folder. You can choose any other one you want, it does not matter
but be careful to update the code snippet with the right value.

### Create our application folder
Open a terminal, go into the `/tmp` folder and create an application folder.

```
cd /tmp
mkdir openApiWorkshop && cd openApiWorkshop
 ```
 
 ### Generate the project
 Once into our project folder, launch JHipster.  Fill the questions with the responses below.
 You can also add the [.yo-rc.json](https://github.com/avdev4j/workshop-openapi/blob/master/resources/.yo-rc.json) 
 provided and launch the JHipster CLI. All the configuration will be loaded from it.
 
 ```
jhipster
 ```
 
 ```
 ? Which *type* of application would you like to create? Monolithic application (recommended for simple projects)
 ? What is the base name of your application? openApiWorkshop

 e)
 ? Do you want to use Hibernate 2nd level cache? Yes

 ? Which other technologies would you like to use? API first development using OpenAPI-generator
 ? Which *Framework* would you like to use for the client? Angular
 ? Would you like to use a Bootswatch theme (https://bootswatch.com/)? Default JHipster
 ? Would you like to enable internationalization support? No
 ? Besides JUnit and Jest, which testing frameworks would you like to use? (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all,
  <i> to invert selection)
 ? Would you like to install other generators from the JHipster Marketplace? No
 ```
 
 As you can see at the following question 
 > Which other technologies would you like to use?
 
 We choose API first development using OpenAPI-generator. JHipster will provide all the configuration we need to use
 OpenApi and do API-First design.
 
 ### Going deep in the generated files
 If you used to use JHipster you will not be surprised by the following generated code. Otherwise 
 I suggest you to take time to understand the architecture.
 Anyway the code is near from a classy Spring Boot/Angular project.
 
 When we choose the OpenAPI option, JHipster has been slightly modified.
 
#### pom.xml
- We have the openApi plugin added
 ```

#### api.yaml
At the following path `src/main/resources/swagger/api.yaml` the api.yaml file contain a sample api file, which 
will be used to define our API contracts. 
This is the heart of our API-First Design.

By default, JHipster provide a 3.0.x api.yaml file, it's possible to use a 2.0.x definition in place.
```
# API-first development with OpenAPI
# This file will be used at compile time to generate Spring-MVC endpoint stubs using openapi-generator
openapi: '3.0.1'
info:
  title: 'openApiWorkshop'
  version: 0.0.1
servers:
  - url: http://localhost:8080/api
    description: Development server
  - url: https://localhost:8080/api
    description: Development server with TLS Profile
paths: {}

components:
  securitySchemes:
    jwt:
      type: http
      description: JWT Authentication
      scheme: bearer
      bearerFormat: JWT
security:
  - jwt: []
```

#### Run the application
In your terminal, write
``` 
./mvnw
```

This will launch both frontend and backend application that will be reachable at the following URL [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

When the following message appear in your teminal, the application is ready !

```

----------------------------------------------------------
	Application 'openApiWorkshop' is running! Access URLs:
	Local: 		http://localhost:8080/
	External: 	http://10.92.16.43:8080/
	Profile(s): 	[dev, swagger]
----------------------------------------------------------

```

#### Explore the API menu
After been identified in the application the admin account (admin/admin), open the API menu.

![The admin API menu](https://github.com/avdev4j/workshop-openapi/blob/master/resources/images/1/admin_api_menu.png)

You should see the swagger-ui with all default JHipster API generated.

We are now ready to generate our own API ! [>>> next](https://github.com/avdev4j/workshop-openapi/blob/master/2.%20Create-our-first-resource.md)
