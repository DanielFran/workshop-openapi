# Mock the API
So you have created your API from a yaml file and this API is now available in your application.
API-First design allows you to work on multiple endpoints and API contracts before implementing 
the business code. Mocking the API will permit you to offer a functional API to your consumers 
early in the development process.

### 501 By default
By default the generated classes expose endpoints that return a generic response with the 501 code
`not implemented.`

![501](https://github.com/avdev4j/workshop-openapi/blob/master/resources/images/3/501.png)

This is not fully satisfying because we do not have a nominal behaviour.

### Mock with the NativeWebRequest
[NativeWebRequest](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/request/NativeWebRequest.html)
> Extension of the {@link WebRequest} interface, exposing the native request and response objects in a generic fashion.
    <p>Mainly intended for framework-internal usage,
   in particular for generic argument resolution code.</p>

You have to create a service, with `@service` annotation, that implement the StudentApiDelegate and provide the NativeWebRequest bean.

```
package io.github.openapiworkshop.service;

import io.github.openapiworkshop.web.api.StudentsApiDelegate;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import org.springframework.web.context.request.NativeWebRequest;

import java.util.Optional;

@Service
public class StudentsApiDelegateImpl implements StudentsApiDelegate {

    private final NativeWebRequest request;

    public StudentsApiDelegateImpl(NativeWebRequest request) {
        this.request = request;
    }

    @Override
    public Optional<NativeWebRequest> getRequest() {
        return Optional.ofNullable(request);
    }
}
```

Our Students API still return a 501 code but with the example bodies.

So, now you have a generated API, you can reach it and have sample bodies to work with. The next step is
to add our business code.
