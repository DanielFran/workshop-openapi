# Consume the workshop by another JHipster application
Now, your API should be run good enought to be use by other applications. To reminder, this is our
goal !

The openapi specifications - and JHipster - will help us to do that easily.

## Create a new JHipster application
In the parent folder, create a new folder for this new application:

From the workshop project folder
```
cd .. && mkdir consumeApiWorkshop && cd consumeApiWorkshop
```
And launch JHipster

```
jhipster
```

We basically want a standard monolith application with all default values.
```
Which *type* of application would you like to create? Monolithic application (recommended for simple projects)
? What is the base name of your application? consumeApiWorkshop
? What is your default Java package name? io.github.openapiworkshop
? Do you want to use the JHipster Registry to configure, monitor and scale your application? No
? Which *type* of authentication would you like to use? JWT authentication (stateless, with a token)
? Which *type* of database would you like to use? SQL (H2, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MSSQL)
? Which *production* database would you like to use? PostgreSQL
? Which *development* database would you like to use? H2 with disk-based persistence
? Do you want to use the Spring cache abstraction? Yes, with the Ehcache implementation (local cache, for a single node)
? Do you want to use Hibernate 2nd level cache? Yes
? Would you like to use Maven or Gradle for building the backend? Maven
? Which other technologies would you like to use? (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection)
? Which *Framework* would you like to use for the client? Angular
? Would you like to use a Bootswatch theme (https://bootswatch.com/)? Default JHipster
? Would you like to enable internationalization support? Yes
? Please choose the native language of the application English
? Please choose additional languages to install (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection)
? Besides JUnit and Jest, which testing frameworks would you like to use? (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all,
 <i> to invert selection)
? Would you like to install other generators from the JHipster Marketplace? No
```
 Once the project is generated, please modify the following files
 .yo-rc.json
 `"serverPort": "8081",`
 
 application-dev.yml
 ```
 server:
    port: 8081
```

To be sur the server will not start on the same port than first application.

## Generate the client Feign configuration
In the same terminal launch the JHipster openapi-client sub-generator. This generator will generate, 
for you, all the configurations needed for call the API, from the api.yml file.

```
jhipster openapi-client
```
And answer to questions, like this:
```
Welcome to the JHipster OpenApi client Sub-Generator
? Where do you want to import your OpenAPI/Swagger specification from ? From the api.yml spec of an existing Jhipster
project
? Enter the path to the jhipster project root directory ../openApiWorkshop
? What is the unique name for your API client (please avoid using Java keywords) ? openApiWorkshop
? Do you want to save this config for future reuse ? Yes
```

After that, you will have a new folder in `src/main/java` named `client`

### Fix
For unknown reasons you need to do some dirty fix to finish this workshop.

From both Student and Teacher API Model

Remove this line 
`import org.openapitools.jackson.nullable.JsonNullable;`

Import LocalDate

`import java.time.LocalDate;`

## Create a DummyResource
For test purpose you need to create a dummy resource will call the workshop API. At this moment this resource is "dummy" 
it's worked only like a proxy and do nothing more.
"In real life", much more scenario exists and will be more complex than this one.

Create a new class in the rest folder `src/main/java/PACKAGE/web/rest`

```
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class DummyResource {

    private DefaultApiClient defaultApiClient;

    public DummyResource(DefaultApiClient defaultApiClient) {
        this.defaultApiClient = defaultApiClient;
    }

    @GetMapping("/dummy")
    public ResponseEntity<List<Student>> getDummy() {
        return defaultApiClient.getAllStudents();
    }
}
```

This class call the `defaultApiClient.getStudents` generated from the api.yml file.

### Test it
Launch the application and access to the API menu (you know how now ;))

Test the dummy-resource!

As expected the call will... failed! And return a 401. The only reason why, is that the workshop
API is protected and need to be login to be call.

## Update the security config in the workshop API
Please do not try this at home, or at school!

Open the SecurityConfiguration.java in the workship API (the first generated project)
and permit all request to `/api/v1/**`.

```
.authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/api/authenticate").permitAll()
            .antMatchers("/api/v1/**").permitAll()
```

re-launch the application.

### re-test it
Now the endpoint is not secure anymore, you could reach it with the dummy resource.

Congratulations !

## Going further
For production mode we can't avoid security as we do in the previous chapter.
For fixing that we could, call the login API and get the token back and add it in a header.
Use Oauth2 as authentication mode.
