# Create our first resource

Now, our application is ready to use, we will work on the API itself.
Before starting this chapter, you should be aware of some available resources and read it.

### Define our first resource
The following code is written with the openapi 2.X specification, to know how to do with a 3+ spec
please refer to the [OpenApi specifications](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/).

we starting with the "info" part. Nothing special here, except for the basPath value.
The `basePath`should stay as is when using JHipster, because it not need extra configuration to be exposed into the swagger UI,
and it follow the JHipster guideline. For your own purpose you could overwrite this value. Be sure to update the JHipster configuration.


```
swagger: '2.0'
info:
  description: 'This is a sample JHipster application with OpenApi option.'
  version: '1.0.0'
  title: 'workshop-openapi'
  contact:
    email: 'anthony.viard@jhipster.tech'
  license:
    name: 'Apache 2.0'
    url: 'http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html'
basePath: '/api'
```

Then we add a new definition, for this workshop we will generate a student API to access to the base student and their teachers.

#### Add the teacher definition 

In the definition part, after the student, add the teacher object defined by an id, a firstname and a lastname.

```
  teacher:
    type: 'object'
    properties:
      id:
        type: 'integer'
        format: 'int64'
      firstname:
        type: 'string'
      lastname:
        type: 'string'
```

#### Add the student definition

Add the end of the file, add a `descriptions` section to manage our objects.
Our student is defined by an id, a firstname, a lastname and a birthday.

```
definitions:
  student:
    type: 'object'
    properties:
      id:
        type: 'integer'
        format: 'int64'
      firstname:
        type: 'string'
      lastname:
        type: 'string'
      birthday:
        type: 'string'
        format: 'date'
      teacher:
        $ref: '#/definitions/teacher'
```

`$ref` is used to link objects to other. A student has one and only one teacher linked to.

#### Add a student array definition
For collection purpose, we have to define a student array. We just have to define a new
entry in the definition part, like this:

```
  students:
    type: 'array'
    items:
      $ref: '#/definitions/student'
```

#### Add path definitions
Now we have both teacher and student objects defined, we add a path definition.

Below the `definitions` part, add a `path` part :

```
paths:
  /students:
    get:
      summary: 'get all students'
      operationId: 'getAllStudents'
      responses:
        200:
          description: 'successful operation'
          schema:
            type: 'array'
            items:
              $ref: '#/definitions/students'
      produces:
        - application/json
  /students/{id}:
    get:
      summary: 'get an student'
      operationId: 'getStudent'
      parameters:
        - name: 'id'
          required: true
          type: 'integer'
          in: 'path'
      responses:
        200:
          description: 'successful operation'
          schema:
            $ref: '#/definitions/student'
      produces:
        - application/json
```

`/students` return a student collection, `schema` ref to the array definition;
`/student/{id}` return a student by his id, schema` ref to object definition.

#### Final result
At this point of the workshop we should have a api.yaml like this:
```
# API-first development with OpenAPI
# This file will be used at compile time to generate Spring-MVC endpoint stubs using openapi-generator

  students:

```

Copy and past the result in the [Swagger editor](http://editor.swagger.io/?_ga=2.149241014.1090305954.1575366310-1969853620.1574417188) and check the result match with our needs.

### Generate sources
Go back in the terminal and generate classes with this command:
```
./mvnw generate-sources
```

When it's done, the generated classes are available in the target folder. `target/`

![The generated classes](https://github.com/avdev4j/workshop-openapi/blob/master/resources/images/2/generated_classes.png)

NB. Your ide, probably, ignore the "target" folder by default. Be sure to reload the maven config to detect the generated classes.
`./mvnw eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse`

`./mvnw idea:idea` 

### Re-run the application and check the swagger-ui
If your application is still running, stop and relaunch it with the maven command

`./mvnw`

Go into the admin menu and select API entry.
You should, now, see our student API in the swagger UI.

Let's mock this API ! [>>> next](https://github.com/avdev4j/workshop-openapi/blob/master/3.%20Mock-the-api.md)
