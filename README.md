## Plan
### Generate our first JHipster application
create a folder, go inside launch JHipster
Choose those options ... (with open API)

explain files, run JHipster do into api menu an see what is present.

## create our first resources

define api info
define a resource, add an endpoint with response and errors

generate sources -> see what sources have been generated

re-launch app and test api

## mock our first resource 
@see NativeWebRequest

## implement our first resource
create a @service 
add code
re-run test

## go further
add array resources ...
many other things ?

## Consume an API 
create a new jhipster application
run open-api client sub generator
