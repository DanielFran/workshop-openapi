# Generate our first JHipster application
First, we need to choose a root folder where we will create all our projects.
To simplify I will use `/tmp` as root folder. You can choose any other one you want, it does not matter
but be careful to update the code snippet with the good value.

### Create our application folder
Open a terminal, go into the `/tmp` folder and create an application folder.

```
cd /tmp
mkdir openApiWorkshop && cd openApiWorkshop
 ```
 
 Once into our project folder launch JHipster.  Fill the questions with the responses below.
 You can also add the [.yo-rc.json](https://github.com/avdev4j/workshop-openapi/blob/master/resources/.yo-rc.json) provided and launch the JHipster cli. All the configuration will be loaded from it.
 
 ```
jhipster
 ```
 
 ```
